# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Ren

I'm a rising junior at Boston College studying Computer Science and Math. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, systems programming, and how technology intersects with equity and education. I love building creative tools and exploring how machine learning and hardware can solve real-world problems.
